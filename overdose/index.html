                It's no longer a question whether America has an opioid epidemic. That fact is nearly indisputable. But opioids aren't the only drugs we abuse and they aren't the only one killing people by the thousands. We've seen the numbers and charts for opioid-related deaths, but what about overall overdoses? How bad is the overdose epidemic, is there anywhere getting better and how bad is bad anyway?

                In 2016, 56,203 people died by overdose in the United States. Adjusted for population, that around 14 people out of every 100,000. To put that in perspective, overdoses accounted for about 1.7% of <i>all</i> deaths in America. In 2013 overdoses passed 15 per 100k accounting for 1.9% of all deaths. And by 2016 it skyrocketed up to more than 22 deaths per 100k or 2.6% of all deaths in the US.

                West Virginia is <a href = 'https://www.washingtonpost.com'>commonly cited</a> as the area most hard hit by the opioid epidemic. Since 2006, the rate of death has steadily increased. In 2006, overdoses accounted for 2.7% of all deaths in the state. By 2016, the number of overdoses per 100k had more than doubled to 65 accounting for more than 5% of all deaths.

                Ohio is, in most regards, unremarkable in the overdose epidemic. Having a much higher population than West Virginia, their statistics look less impressive when normalized, but they are close to the "average" american state.

                Data was collected from the CDC's 'Multiple Cause of Death Data' through their <a href='https://wonder.cdc.gov'>WONDER tool</a>. The CDC does not release data from a state if there are less than 10 deaths. Becuase of this, states which had less than 10 deaths in any year between 2006 and 2016 were not used in this analysis. The CDC no longer releases the specific drugs involved in the overdoses, however they have a seperate category for alcohol related ODs.<br>
